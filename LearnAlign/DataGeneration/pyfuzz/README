Execute pgen-example.py to generate a new random program and output it to
stdout.

Execute pygen-example.py to test a python binary. You must specify a base and
a test binary using the -b and -t commandline options.

The pygen directory contains a module to represent a python program as an
object tree and transform it into a text representation.
